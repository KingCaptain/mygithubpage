          <h2>Formula Electric</h2>

          <div id="left-side">
            When it comes to vehicles, I’ve always been interested in going as fast as possible.
             It’s led to a few speeding tickets, but it has most importantly led me to the
             Formula Electric team at Missouri S and T. I started working with the team in the fall of 2015,
             and I’ve been addicted ever since. I spent the majority of that semester on re-designing the
             accumulator to accommodate for an aluminum enclosure as opposed to the initial composite enclosure design.
             When November rolled around, I was offered a semester-long co-op, which I accepted.

           <div id="right-side">
             My co-op with Hubbell Power Systems was a great experience, and I used my spare time to
             determine whether or not I wanted to continue along the path of Mechanical Engineering.
             After a while, I decided to change my studies to Computer Science.
             On the weekends I spent in Rolla, I worked with our team’s electrical engineers to set up an
             80-kilowatt dynamometer to fine tune our car’s control systems. When officer elections arrived,
             I was elected to be the team’s president for the 2016-2017 year. Since the election, I’ve
             been spending as much time as I can pushing the team to learn new methods of
             making our car as well designed and as fast as possible.
