          <h2>Formula Electric</h2>

          <div id="left-side">
            I am the current president of the S&amp;T Formula Electric Racing design team. I've always been interested in going as fast as possible,
						and I truly got to realize that dream when I joined the team. We build a scale formula-style race-car capable of accelerating
						from 0-60 miles per hour in three seconds. We've placed in the top five teams in both of the international competitions that we've participated in,
						which are held in Lincoln, Nebraska. When I'm not studying or in class, it's pretty easy to find me at our shop, the E3 commons, or at the school's student design center.
						Our team would not exist without the hard work and dedication of every one of our members.

           </div>

           <div id="right-side">
             Every subsystem such as the control system, frame, suspension, etc. has
						 thousands of hours of designing and manufacturing poured into it. In this great organization, my role is to make sure everything comes together. I keep morale high
						 when times get rough, and I make sure everything stays on track. I do a little bit of everything from battery design to simple accelerometer implementation,
						 and I find myself getting more and more addicted as each day goes by. I constantly try to push our members to learn as much as possible, and we're hungry for an
						 even higher podium finish this year.

				<h2>Hubbell Power Systems</h2>
				<div id="left-side-hubbell">
					I took a semester away from school to spend on a co-op with Hubbell Power Systems in the spring of 2016. During my co-op, I learned more about myself than I ever would
					have imagined. One of my self-assigned projects was to write an in-depth visual software guide for all of my colleagues in the present and the future to follow, as it
					seemed I had a much firmer grasp on our storage software than most.	While I enjoyed each day in the office,
					I truly wanted to be able to create more freely, and software design never left my head. These thoughts combined with research led me to switch majors from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science.
				</div>
				<div id="right-side-hubbell">
					Every day following my decision to switch majors was spent diving further into the depths of what the combination of hardware and software could create.
					I noticed that one of the other employees was updating massive amounts of test data online manually, and that it could be easily automated to reduce an immense amount of time spent entering data.
					After a few days of work, I had entirely automated the data gathering process. I started taking online classes at night to make up for any time that I might have lost,
					and I filled the remainder of my day researching many different possible projects to work on in the future. I am a dreamer, and I have Hubbell to thank for helping me realize what I really desire.

					<div id="left-side-travel">
						I love to explore the world. Whether it's a new hiking trail, a new mountain to climb, or an adventure in a different country, I'll be up for the challenge. I've hiked all over my home state of Missouri,
						I've climbed a few mountains in Colorado, and I've explored a few places in Ohio. My list might not be incredibly long, but I've got plenty of places that I have yet to check off.
